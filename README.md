# Matías Pedulla

I'm Matías, Argentine 🇦🇷 born, Spanish 🇪🇸 citizen, living in Ireland 🇮🇪 and newby JS developer 😁.

Although I graduated from Law School with a JD degree 👨‍⚖️, I decided to take a serious turn in my carreer when I moved to Dublin in 2021. After more than a year working on in Accenture I decided to sign up for a full stack developer bootcamp 💻. Needless to say, it ended up being one of the most interesting things I've done in my life (it still amazes me how much things you can do after a few months of intense learning 👨‍🎓).

My goal now is to get into the labor market to put what I have learned into practice, gain experience, deepen my knowledge and, eventually, be able to contribute something of my own to this field✨.
